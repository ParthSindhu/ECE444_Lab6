## Part 3

### What are the Pros and Cons of TDD ?

#### Pros

Following test driven development forces you to plan your code beforehand since the outputs of each function are decided first. This creates more structurally sound code which is easier to maintain as well. Furthermore ensuring the code has adequate test coverage prevents regressions, and new features which might break existing features.

#### Cons

Strictly following TDD and Writing tests can be a very time consuming process, which the team might not be able to commit to. The tests also have to be independent from each other, and if they are not well written, they can be hard to manage and reduce developer velocity.
